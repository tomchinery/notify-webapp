    <h1>Notify</h1>
    <p>
      The scope of this project far exceeds this hackathon. Bearing this in mind
      I am submitting a sample app that demonstrates more of a proof of concept.
    </p>
  </div>

  <section  ng-app="notifyapp" class="app">
    <fake-notification></fake-notification>

    <add-notification></add-notification>
    <delete-notification></delete-notification>

    <div class="controls">
      <span>Notify</span>
      <i class="fa fa-plus right" ng-click="this.$emit('addNotification')"></i>
    </div>

    <div ng-controller="notificationsListController" class="list">
      <div class="notification" ng-repeat="notification in notifications">
        <div class="left-hover-container">
          <div class="left-hover-controls">
            <i class="fa fa-times danger" ng-click="this.$emit('deleteNotification', notification)"></i>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3>{{ notification.title }}</h3>
        <p>
          {{ notification.body }}
        </p>
        <div class="right-hover-container">
          <div class="right-hover-controls">
            <i class="fa fa-clock-o time"></i>
            <i class="fa fa-pencil edit"></i>
            <i class="fa fa-bell test" ng-click="this.$emit('showNotification', notification)"></i>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <div class="intro bt">
    <h1>How to use</h1>

    <ul class='how'>
      <li>
        Add notifications by clicking the plus icon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Delete notifications by hovering over the left of a notification and clicking
        the cross icon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Test notifications by hovering over the right of a notification and clicking
        the bell icon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Edit notifications by hovering over the right of a notification and clicking
        the pencil icon.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Vision</h1>
    <p>
      The vision of notify is to be able to create and schedule custom notifications
      on every platform in one place. The idea came to me when I was frustrated
      with to-do app notifications, I was setting up my to-do's each day but would
      only get notified on one platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      I still want to explore some features which are not in the app above. Such
      as being able to schedule a notification for a specific platform,
      date and time selection, and using device gestures.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reason why I say the project is out of scope of this hackathon is that
      I plan on pursuing this idea and releasing the app on multiple platforms in
      the coming months.
    </p>

    <h1>Notes: </h1>

    <p>
      Although basic I hope the app gives you an idea
      of what I'm going for. Given I had more time I would implement:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li> - Date and Time scheduling </li>
      <li> - User sign up and authentication </li>
      <li> - Animations for app events </li>
    </ul>
